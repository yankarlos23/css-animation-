# css-animations

## Learning Target
- I am learning how to create CSS animations

## Success Criteria
- I can use ```@keyframes animation-name``` to define an animation
- I can create animations that use the ```transform``` and ```opacity``` properties
- I can use ```animation: name duration;``` to apply an animation with a selector



# Get started
1. Install Live Server and Go Live to view how the webpage looks with no styling
2. Follow directions below

## 1. Define animations with ```@keyframes```
Define values at specific percentages of the animation. You can specify any percentage values for steps in the animation.
```css
@keyframes animation-name {
    0% {
        /* starting properties */
    }
    25% {
        /* properties after 25% of time as elapsed */
    }
    50% {
        /* properties at 50% */
    }
    75% {
        /* properties at 75% */
    }
    100% {
        /* properties at 100% (the end) */
    }
}
```
### Common properties to animate
```css
background-color:
color:
transform: scale() | rotate() | translate() | skew();
opacity: /* 0 is fully transparent, 1 (or 100%) is fully opaque */
```

## 2. Apply animation to a selector
```css
selector {
    animation: name duration timing-function;
}
```
For example:
```css
img {
    animation: spin 1s linear;
}
```
You can *optionally* set other properties to control how the animation behaves
```css
selector {
    animation: name duration timing-function;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite; /* repeat infinitely or a specific number of times */
    animation-delay: 1s; /* start animation after 1s */
    animation-fill-mode: forwards; /* The element will keep its ending animation properties */
}

```

## Transform property
```css
selector {
    transform: translate(x, y) | scale(%) | rotate(deg) | skew(deg, deg);
}
```

# Example 1
1. Make all the ```img``` elements spin
2. Make the bear move back and forth

# Practice Assignment
1. Make the elephant "disapper" when clicked (shrink and fade the opacity to 0)
2. Make the giraffe "dance" when clicked (maybe rotate back and forth while moving up and down a little)
3. Make the hippo "jump" when clicked (move a little down, then way up and back)
4. Do something creative with the tiger. See what you can come up with

# Example 2
Follow along with my example to use animations to make a nice hero section and nav
1. Use position and flex properties to create a layout for headings and nav
2. Add slide-in animations to headings
3. Add fade-in animation to nav
4. Add hover effect and transition
